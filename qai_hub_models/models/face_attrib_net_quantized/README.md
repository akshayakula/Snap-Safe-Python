# [Facial-Attribute-Detection-Quantized: Comprehensive facial analysis by extracting face features](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/face_attrib_net_quantized)

Facial feature extraction and additional attributes including liveness, eyeclose, mask and glasses detection for face recognition.

This is based on the implementation of Facial-Attribute-Detection-Quantized found [here](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-models/blob/main/qai_hub_models/models/face_attrib_net/model.py). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm速 devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/face_attrib_net_quantized).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm速 device.




## Example & Usage


Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.face_attrib_net_quantized.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This repository contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.face_attrib_net_quantized.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option. Note that the above
script requires access to Deployment instructions for Qualcomm速 AI Hub.
