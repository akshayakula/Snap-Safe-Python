# [RTMPose_Body2d: Human pose estimation](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/rtmpose_body2d)

RTMPose is a machine learning model that detects human pose and returns a location and confidence for each of 133 joints.

This is based on the implementation of RTMPose_Body2d found [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmpose). This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device
export suitable to run on Qualcomm速 devices. More details on model performance
accross various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/rtmpose_body2d).

[Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to start using Qualcomm AI Hub and run these models on a hosted Qualcomm速 device.




## Example & Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install "qai-hub-models[rtmpose-body2d]" torch==2.4.1 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cpu/torch2.4/index.html
```


Once installed, run the following simple CLI demo:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.rtmpose_body2d.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment

This repository contains export scripts that produce a model optimized for
on-device deployment. This can be run as follows:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.rtmpose_body2d.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option. Note that the above
script requires access to Deployment instructions for Qualcomm速 AI Hub.
